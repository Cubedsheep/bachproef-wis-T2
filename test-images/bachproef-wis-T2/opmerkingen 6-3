Magnetic field: B in the plane: in x- or y-direction

!!try different values for beta=p/(B²/2) (eg. 1, 0.1, 5...)

calculate the velocity of the wave by calculating the position of the boundary at each time step. --> compare with MHD waves. slows down because of boundary condition? (group speed)
these HD waves are non-dispersive.

calculate phase velocity

boundary condition: OK

Find diagram of group speed of MHD waves (+literature?)


Third tasks: change units! (default length scale, number density)
		Initial condition!! --> need to balance the structure: in code units make P+B²/2 =constant on whole domain in code units
		second step: setup boundary condition: see sample (time dependent boundary?)
		for other parameters: folow paper
